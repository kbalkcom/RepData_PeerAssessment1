\section{ }{
You can find important course-specific tips and notes for your Lab Sandbox in \cr
this quick guide to use throughout your course. You’ll be able to reference this \cr
at any time or visit the \href{https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/360062301971}{Learner Help Center} 
for more info.

\section{What tools are already installed in my sandbox environment?}{
\itemize{
    \item Swirl is already installed in this environment but you will \cr
still have to load swirl from the library, and install the \cr
R Programming course file into swirl. You will need to use \cr
the manual install process which is outlined below to install \cr
the R Programming course file, which is in the Lab Sandbox \cr
environment, into swirl.
}
}

\section{How can I load Swirl in my Sandbox?}{
The commands you use to load swirl are different in this lab \cr
than the instructions you may have read previously (see image below).\cr
The commands/options you will use are:
\itemize{
    \item library(swirl)
    \item swirl::install_course()
    \item Select “R_Programming.swc” when prompted
    \item swirl()
    \item Enter your name when prompted
    \item Return until you are asked to select, 1, 2 or3
    \item Select 3 “Let’s get going!”
    \item Return until you are asked to select, 1 or 2
    \item Select 1. R Programming \cr

    \item You are then ready to complete the assignment in the
    same way you would on your local machine (as per the instructions \cr
    provided in the course Coursera shell).\cr
    \item To receive credit for your work within the Coursera shell, \cr
    follow the prompts at the end of the swirl lesson using the email \cr
    connected to your Coursera account, and a token you generate \cr
    in the appropriate assignment page in course Coursera shell.\cr
